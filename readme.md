# Surfs Up : A climate analysis for icecream shop suitability in Hawaii and elsewhere

## Project Overview

The purpose of this assignment was to support a business developer in analyzing climate data for select locations to determine whether those areas had suitable climate for establishment of an icecream shop. Surfers were the primary target market for these ice cream shops, so the analysis inadvertantly identifies prime surfing weather. We analyzed the hottest month (June) and coldest month (December) to determine whether these months fit within a "comfortable" zone for consuming icecream outside.

## Results

#### Temperature for hottest and coolest months

| Statistics    | June Temperature | December Temperature |
| ------------- | ---------------- | -------------------- |
| Minimum Value | 64&deg;F         | 56&deg;F             |
| Maximum Value | 85&deg;F         | 83&deg;F             |
| Average Value | 74&deg;F         | 71&deg;F             |

## Summary

- This analysis indicates that the average maximum temperature, and average temperature, for the warmest and coolest months are within 3F of eachother. From experience with icecream, these temperatures are optimal for consuming and selling icecream. During December, minimum temperatures dip to around 56F which could lead to a drop in sales. However, according to the histogram, the number of days that are below 65, even in December, and quite low.
